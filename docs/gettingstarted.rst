Getting Started
===============

Installing Sandman
------------------

For non-Steam installations, simply run the provided installer. On Windows, you will need to select your VST directory if the installer doesn't pick the right one by default.

For Steam installations, download Sandman through your Steam Library page, under "My Software". After Sandman is downloaded, run it once through Steam to install pre-requisites and to open the Unfiltered Audio Plug-in Manager. Once the manager is opened, click "Install" to install Sandman.


Syncing Presets With Steam Cloud
--------------------------------

On Steam, Sandman provides the ability to store your presets on Steam Cloud. This allows you to access your presets on every computer that you install Sandman on. 

To set it up, run the Unfiltered Audio Plug-in Manager through Steam by selecting "Run" on your Sandman Library Page. From there, click "Enable Steam Cloud". This will create a folder called "SteamCloud" in your user presets directory. All presets saved to this directory will be automatically backed up to the Steam Cloud every time you run the Plug-in Manager.

Browsing Presets
----------------

Sandman comes with a wide array of presets to get you started. The preset manager on the top of Sandman's interface is used to load, save, or browse presets. If you want to get a good feel for the power of Sandman, spend some time with these presets before browsing the manual.
